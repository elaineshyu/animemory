Project made during Kode with Klossy (summer of 2017) with Kennedy Morganfield and Anya Nutakki. All work was done on Cloud9 using a shared repository and pushed to Kennedy's github for deployment. 

Primarily used Aframe for VR and tested on Samsung Headsets. Front-end was developed through HTML and CSS. I primarily worked on the Javascript file (i.e. connecting clicking on images to the correct sounds and information boxes, etc).

Project made during Kode with Klossy with Kennedy Morganfield and Anya Nuttaki. Primarily used Aframe for VR and tested on Samsung Headsets. Front-end was developed through HTML and CSS. All work was done on Cloud9 using a shared repository and pushed to github for deployment. I primarily worked on the backend using Javascript (i.e. connecting clicking on images to the correct sounds and information boxes, etc).
